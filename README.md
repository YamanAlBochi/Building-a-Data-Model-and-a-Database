# Building-a-Data-Model-and-a-Database
A mini project to showcase my skills with Basics Data Models, starting from what is data model, why is data modelling important, relational model and database to ACID properties continued with an exercise of creating a table with PostgreSQL..

(1- I go through basics and concepts of a topic of Data Modelling, Database and ACID.)

(2- I create a table with columns and rows with Jupyter NoteBook integrated with PostgreSQL.)

(3. I work with the data, building a data model then deploying the data model into a database.)
